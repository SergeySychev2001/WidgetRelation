# WidgetRelation

A small TypeScript playground that demonstrates building widget trees with horizontal and vertical containers. Widgets can be aligned within their parent container and rendered to the DOM.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The demo page will open in the browser via webpack-dev-server.
